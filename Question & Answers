I have used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for this project.


Database Name - PizzaSales

Tables - orders, pizzas, pizza_type, order_details
select * from orders
select * from pizzas
select * from pizza_types
select * from order_details


--Basic
--1. Retrieve the total number of orders placed.

select count(order_id) as Total_Orders from orders


--2. Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.

select round(sum(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price),2) as Total_Revenue
from order_details join pizzas
on order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id


--3. Identify the highest-priced pizza.

select round(MAX(price),2) as highest_Priced_Pizza from pizzas 

select top 1 pizza_types.name, pizzas.price
from pizzas join pizza_types
on pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
order by pizzas.price desc


--4. Identify the most common pizza size ordered.

select pizzas.size, COUNT(order_details.order_details_id) as order_count
from pizzas join order_details
on pizzas.pizza_id = order_details.pizza_id
group by size
order by order_count desc

--5. List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

select top 5 pizza_types.name,sum(order_details.quantity) as quantity
from pizza_types join pizzas
on pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
join order_details on order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
group by pizza_types.name
order by quantity desc




--Intermediate:
--1. Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.

select pizza_types.category,sum(order_details.quantity) as Quantity
from pizza_types join pizzas
on pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
join order_details
on order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
group by pizza_types.category
order by Quantity desc


--2. Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.

select datepart(hour, time) as Hours, COUNT(order_id) as Total_Count from orders
group by datepart(hour, time)
order by Total_Count desc 


--3. Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.

select category, COUNT(name) as Total_Count from  pizza_types
group by category


--4. Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.

select avg(Quantity) as  Average_Quantity from
(select orders.date, SUM(order_details.quantity) as Quantity
from orders join order_details
on orders.order_id = order_details.order_id
group by orders.date) as Order_quantity


--5. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

select top 3 pizza_types.name, sum(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price) as revenue
from pizza_types join pizzas
on pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
join order_details 
on order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
group by pizza_types.name
order by revenue desc


--Advanced:
--1. Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.

select pizza_types.category, round(SUM(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price) / 
(select sum(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price) as Total_revenue
from order_details join pizzas
on order_details. pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id) *100,2) as revenue
from pizza_types join pizzas
on pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
join order_details
on order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
group by pizza_types.category
order by revenue desc


--2. Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.

select date, sum(revenue) over (order by date) as cum_revenue
from
(select orders.date, SUM(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price) as revenue
from orders join order_details
on orders.order_id = order_details.order_id
join pizzas
on order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
group by orders.date) as Sales


--3. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.

select category, name, revenue
from
(select category, name, revenue,
rank() over (partition by category order by revenue desc) as CategoryWiseRank
from
(select pizza_types.category,pizza_types.name,
SUM(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price) as revenue
from pizza_types join pizzas
on pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
join order_details
on order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
group by pizza_types.category,pizza_types.name) as A) as B
where CategoryWiseRank <= 3
